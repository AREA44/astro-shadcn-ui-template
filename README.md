## Features

- [Astro](https://astro.build): A modern static site builder that allows you to write components using familiar web standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed styling classes to rapidly build user interfaces.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): A collection of reusable UI components for building responsive and accessible interfaces.
- The template includes support for a theme toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.

## How to add components

Shadcn UI is a collection of re-usable components that can be easily integrated into your applications. It is not a component library, but rather a set of components that you can copy and paste into your projects.

To add a new component to your application, please refer to the [configuration guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/astro#thats-it).

For detailed documentation on using Shadcn UI, please visit the [full documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

Shadcn UI is primarily built for the React framework. If you are unfamiliar with framework components in Astro, we recommend reading the [framework components guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) to get started.

Feel free to explore the various components and enhance your application with Shadcn UI!
